Jay, or Jay for short, doesn't share the same upbeat, hyper personality. She instead relates more to the rest of Pinkie's family, especially her favorite aunt, Maud. Jay always loved camping when she was a foal, and that's about the only thing that actually got her excited. Happy to see her express emotions, her parents would take her camping almost every weekend, sometimes with friends like Applejack and Rainbow Dash. When Jay got older, she needed to find work, and while she still hasn't found something she absolutely enjoys, for now she works as a camp counselor for the new Cutie Mark Crusaders. [/bq]",

      "description": "\"Day 56\r\nToday, I stumbled across destroyed buildings, covered in thick layer of snow. Those were remains of Autumnfield as I later learned. On a closer inspection, it seems some of them were burned down. The whole place was so barren, probably stripped from useful materials for other use. The atmosphere was… unease, I had a feeling that something terrible has happened in here. I'm currently renting a little room in a tavern, in a village of Honeyground. It’s very isolated place, very far away from the previous village I stayed in. I missed some good warm food and comfy bed. I asked some locals if they could tell me more about the surrounding areas. They said that back in the day, this place was full of life, but all ended when an outbreak happened, few years ago. Shadowlings destroyed two other villages, Hackberry and Autumnfield and attacked a castle, leaving only few survivors that were lucky enough to run away in time. Now, there are only ruins left, an creepy reminder of those times. Locals believe that it was a miracle that their village survived, since it was left untouched by those monsters. I think I should visit the remains of Hackberry and ruins of that castle, maybe I will find something that will help me in my investigation. The temperature is getting lower and  snow seems to never stop falling from the sky. What a terrible time for such things.\"\r\n- one of the journal entries written by Fading Spark, exact date unknown\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn poster I made some time ago, decided to edit it and finally upload. Its nothing amaing, I'm simply exercising scenebuilding. Ignore my bad grammar. Enjoy! ",

The reason for this was the top people at Bronycon did not want the attendees and even much of the staff going through the weekend with any type of sadness about 2019 being the last Bronycon. To make sure people did not even suspect that 2019 might be the last year, the book purposely has the 2nd-4th, or 3 convention days like previous years.\r\n\r\nEven the Bronycon mascots did not know about 2019 being the last year until about an hour before closing ceremonies. If you'd like to hear more about that story from a mascot's perspective, please check out \"this video\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjIAOwFV2ec&ab_channel=Simul by Simul, the cosplayer who portrayed Hoof Beatz from 2015-2019.\r\n\r\nWhile this announcement did leave many people feeling sad about Bronycon ending, much of the discussion among staff started almost immediately after the announcement with one goal in mind. Making Bronycon 2019 the best one yet. There was fun things on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"Previous\":/images/2505163",

      "description": "This one is more of a reimagining than a 100% redo. \r\n\r\nThe orchards of Sweet Apple Acres had been infected by a strange crop disease, and weren't producing as many apples as normal. Fearing that She and her family would go hungry, Applejack decided to secretly start manufacturing drugs, as a temporary job. Unbeknownst to Granny Smith, Big Mac, and Applebloom, AJ set up a lab hidden off of Apple property and sold her product to distributors who sold it to dealers, who sold it to customers. After approximately 18 months of dealing on the black market, things started to improve on the farm, with the Orchirds having been rid of their crop disease. Applejack wasted no time in dismantling her lab and sold off all equipment and left over product, and eliminated any evidence of her illicit activities. Thinking, she was in the clear, Applejack resumed life as normal, until one night, a loud knock was heard. Applejack answered the door, and was greeted by two stallions in suits. They were agents from Equestria's ADEM (Anti-Drug-Enforcement-Ministry.) and they were tipped off by a former distributor, and within seconds, cuffed and hauled AJ away. At her Arrainment, Applejack was charged with the following; Manufacturing illicit narcotics, Sale of Illicit narcotics, Drug Trafficking, and possession with intent to distribute.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the news of AJ's arrest, The apple Family and the rest of mane 6 quickly pooled in money so that AJ could afford a Good Defense Attorney, and after several days of battling it out in court, Applejack was found not guilty on Manufacturing, Possession, and Trafficking, but was however found guilty on selling illicit drugs. Applejack was sentence was reduced from a maximum of 15 years, to just 30 months of imprisonment, and was eligible for early release after serving 18 months.",

      "description": "Just a picture of the OC I created and used for most of my art. A few things to note:\r\n\r\n* He was originally going to have an artifact shaped like a pentagram which would have been his source of magic. I never actually uploaded any art of him using magic except for the one image where he entered the dream realm, but we know he's capable of killing alicorn princesses so he must be very powerful. I decided to make his red eyes his source of magic instead which is probably better because it doesn't have any satanic imagery.\r\n* I considered reforming him but this would not have worked as his nature would have caused him to become evil again. Instead I made him more evil and irredeemable as his story progressed. I could reform him at any time but at this point any redemption would be poorly written.\r\n* When I originally uploaded >>2497324, I said I drew out two endings, ultimately deciding to upload the one in which luna is killed. The other, rejected ending would have resulted in the OC and Luna becoming lovers.\r\n* Originally he was going to be partnered with Queen Chrysalis and even drew out a comic at one point where befriending Twilight was just apart of their plan. This was dropped, possibly because Chrysalis was too hard to draw or because it was poorly written.\r\n* If I kept drawing images of manerg x octavia, I would have eventually drawn a wedding between the two in which Cozy Glow shows up with a machine gun and shoots them both turning the wedding into a funeral.\r\n* Finally, I was going to give him a tragic backstory but decided I was trying too hard to make this OC sympathetic and decided he didn't need any sympathy and he shouldn't tell others about his past. He's just a man who doesn't like capitalism and alicorns. Maybe he has some sort of connection with Grogar?\r\n\r\nThe next image I upload will probably be the last one and will put an end to his misery.",

      "description": "A bit more of a somber piece for this scene. Enjoy~\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soft click of hooves on crystal flooring echoed through the hall, making any guard in the area turn their heads to see who was approaching. As the eldest princess turned the corner, they all bowed their heads out of both habit and respect, uttering the same thing they did when any royalty passed them: “Your Highness”. \r\n\r\nPersephone barely seemed to hear them, walking past with only a small nod as her eyes stayed glued ahead of her. She seemed lost in thought, wandering the castle if only to calm her mind. Unlike her usual appearance, with flawlessly coiffed curled hair and a proud posture, the Crown Princess now roamed the halls in a way most of the castle staff had never seen. Her mane lay limp on her head, hanging as straight as if she had been out in the rain. She no longer held her head high with dignity, such body language leaving the guards in silent confusion. Was the princess alright? Should they go get someone? But none moved, not wanting to overstep their bounds.\r\n\r\nBesides those working through the night, the castle was empty. There were no lights, only the occasional candle from castle staff as they sluggishly completed necessary chores. As Persephone made her way to the throne room, a door behind her opened with familiar golden eyes peeking through the crack. Seeing her older sister, the pegasus smiled. Persie, however, did not. \r\n\r\n“You should be in bed, Snowflake.”\r\n\r\nShrugging, Snow Quartz opened her door enough to enter the hall, covered in a thick, fluffy robe. She seemed wide awake, which wasn’t a surprise to her older sister in any way. With all the naps Snow took, it was surprising that she could get any rest at night.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t sleep.” Snow muttered. “And it looks like you couldn’t either. Should we go down to the kitchens and get some cocoa?”\r\n\r\nAt this, Persephone shook her head. “I’m not in a cocoa mood, go ahead without me.”\r\n\r\nSnow Quartz immediately started to catch wind of her sister’s dampened spirit, either that or her eyes began to adjust to the dark of the hallway. “I can’t remember the last time you wore your hair like that. If it’s not perfectly fixed, it’s in curlers.” She laughed at her own words, clearly attempting to brighten the mood. When it didn’t work, and made the changeling shuffle uncomfortably, Snow’s smile faded. “Persie, what’s wrong? I’ll walk with you.”\r\n\r\nThe oldest princess nodded silently and they began to walk, her little sister having to take two steps for every one of Persephone’s long strides, even as she walked slower to try and match pace with the pegasus. It took a few minutes of Persie opening her mouth and closing it repeatedly, as if she figured out what she wanted to say and immediately decided against it, before actually speaking. \r\n\r\n“I look a lot more like her than I thought.” She muttered, looking away momentarily to take a shaky breath. Her little sister turned her head, giving a puzzled expression. \r\n\r\n“Who? You mean Mom?” The pieces started to connect in Snow’s head as the words fell out of her mouth, and she realized a few seconds too late what Persie had really meant. “Oh, you mean… HER her, right?”\r\n\r\nThe changeling princess nodded slowly, glancing over to her sister as they neared the throne room. “I tricked Sunburst into showing me a picture of her. He keeps a private collection of old books in his room and I knew one of them had to show her somewhere…” With her magic, she opened the large doors, her parent’s thrones coming into view. Overwhelmed with emotion, a few tears fell from Persie’s eyes and onto the cold crystal floor. “I didn’t think she’d look so much like me. And it makes me think… others will see me as they saw her, even if I do everything right like Mom.” \r\n\r\nSnow Quartz listened quietly, knowing that her sister would start talking more if she just let her. Once it seemed like Persie had said everything she wanted, it was the young mare’s turn to try and make the changeling smile. “Well even if you look like her, I still think you’re bound to be much prettier! You’ve got such pretty blue eyes and your shiny armor makes it look like you’re wearing big gemstones. I think you’re beautiful.” \r\n\r\nPersie gave a small smile, but it was fleeting and disappeared within seconds. It was clear that the next thing she said had been on her mind longer than tonight. “Do you think everyone deserves love? Even if they came from a place of deception? Even if they were born because of a lie?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I could be the child of Mom if I didn’t believe everyone deserved love.” Snow responded, trying once again to be lighthearted before giving a more somber answer “Persie, none of what happened was your fault. You couldn’t have controlled any part of that situation. You weren’t even born yet. I don’t think you get punished because of something you didn’t do.”\r\n\r\nMore tears rolled down Persephone’s cheeks, her head lowering as she slumped her posture even more than before. “But how can anyone see past that? No one will ever fully forget the invasion of Canterlot or all of the damage she did. How can someone look at me and not see the spawn of a tyrant, even after Mom took me in as her own?” Persie paused and glanced down to her little sister, her sorrowful blue eyes being the only real light in the throne room. “Snow, how can I believe there’s someone out there for me that can look past it, when I can’t even do that?”\r\n\r\n“Because someone is going to be asking the same thing when they meet you.” The pegasus stated confidently. “I’m sure you’re not the only one that feels like this, Persie. I know you didn’t come from the most normal place, and it hurts you to know the truth, but someone will be able to relate to you in some way. And they’ll realize that you’re an amazing, beautiful, strong creature who does her very best every day to be better than her past. And if they don’t see it, they’re dumb.” Snow Quartz smiled up at her big sister, knowing that even if Persie’s frown stayed, at least she would hear the words of a pony who absolutely adored her. \r\n\r\nAnother brief smile crossed the changeling’s face before she glanced back up to the empty throne and sighed. Her mind seemed to finally slow and as she turned, her glowing eyes landed back on her little sister. “You still want to get some cocoa, Snowflake? It sounds good after all.”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely!” Snow grinned, catching up with Persie by quickening her pace. \r\n\r\nThe two walked to the kitchens without speaking much more, Persephone occasionally peeking over to look at her excitable sister. She felt so much love flowing from the small pegasus, and it was all directed at her older sister. The emotion was as sweet as any dessert and Persie consumed a small portion of it as it flitted in the air around her. Snow Quartz glanced up to her, knowing well enough that her sister, just like any changeling, fed off of the love provided to her. \r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, you can eat more than that. I have plenty, and I doubt I’ll run out any time soon.” Snow mentioned, sure that feeding would make her sister feel better, even if it was only temporary.\r\n\r\nPersie gave a sheepish smile, accepting Snow’s offer and taking a bit more of the pure, delicious emotion for herself. Perhaps she wouldn’t find that kind of love, not like her parents, but she could hardly deny that she was unloved in this moment.",

      "description": "First started planning this one back in February after HarmonyCon. Finally got around to finishing it.\r\n\r\n This is another New Bright Ford Raptor like my Nightmare Moon and Daybreaker ones. This time I wanted to go with a general one instead of a character based truck. I decided on an Elements of Harmony theme.\r\nFor the paint, I used two colors of metallic blue (the darker one actual Dodge midnight blue car paint), with the lighter blue fading into the darker (it left the finish kind of rough at the transition but it worked. Rims are painted Inca gold. Decals were made on my computer. The rainbow strip has the cutie marks of the mane 6 on it.\r\n\r\n The Elements of Harmony on the hood are acrylic gems with a hole drilled in the bottom to allow a LED to shine through (they're not shaped like the actual elements, but I couldn't find any that matched).\r\n\r\n And of course it wouldn't be complete without a LED light package. The 3 lower lights on front slowly change color. Ground effect lights are the 6 colors of the rainbow, with color matched Elements of Harmony on the hood.\r\n\r\n There was a disappointment though. This one didn't come with the flashing light bar on top like the others. So I got online and found a kit for a sequencer. It used 8 LEDs though so I put the 2 extra ones over the front wheels. Since I could only use white LEDs, I had to put photogels in front of the lights to get the colors. Unlike the two different flashes the others have, this one can go through 10-12 different sequences; either one after another of you can press a pushbutton and change it to a certain pattern. The sequencer runs on 9 volts while the other LEDs use 6 volts (4 D batteries).\r\n\r\n Aside from cracking the front windshield and another part, this one went along fairly well. Unfortunately you won't see it at HarmonyCon (or any other con) until at least 2022 (thanks Corona-Chan you bitch).\r\n\r\n Who knows? It might go to a convention with me, but not leave it with me.",

This character was an interesting challenge for me because the character reference I had was done in style very different than mine. Very cartoony. It looked great, but I did have to stare at it for awhile until I felt I could extract the important visual features that made the character identifiable. \r\n\r\n    The instructions I was given were pretty straightforward. Sapphi in a holiday sweater, knee high stockings, and smile. That was all. Oh, and a mug of hot chocolate.\r\n\r\n    This Saturday 12/12/20 starting at 5:30pm Pacific I'll be streaming on Picarto Picarto Icon . So join for an evening of art, stories, D&D report, and some really great folks. See you there.\r\n\r\nI hope you like what you see.

Probably better than kissing Canterlot's collective ass every single day.\"\r\n--\r\n\r\nokay gonna squeeze one more in before I go on a short vacation because I have a serious addiction to drawing ponies and I have so many ideas that build and build until they spill out like art diarrhea. \r\n\r\n Quibble Pants and Trenderhoof are bröthers. Very argumentative, very passive aggressive and very pretentious brothers. Trend is the little brother, Quibs is the big brother. They each think each other's careers are stupid (in the most brotherly way). Trenderhoof  is an influencer and Quibble is a writer and writing critic. They fight a lot but it's through that playful banter that they show each other love, and it makes family reunions raucous disasters of screaming ponies. A room with Rainbow Dash, Quibble Pants, Brick Hoof, Zephyr Breeze, Trenderhoof and Connie leaves Plumeria, Bastion Breeze and Fluttershy to quietly chat in the kitchen. Larkspur usually stays outside or in another room entirely during these horrible reunions.\r\n\r\n This does mean that Larkspur is Plumeria and Connie's cousin, something that Connie will strongly emphasize is not \"by blood.\" And this also means that Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash are sisters-in-laws. Everyone's related, good lord! This also also means I'm dropping that whole half-hearted thing between Plumeria and Bastion, one: because they're family now, and two: because it's just a rehash of Rainbow Dash being harassed by Zephyr. \r\n\r\n And rest assured I'm gonna update the next gen chart when I come back to sort out this new mess I've created. x3 ",

      "description": "So, I really hate to do this, but I don't have any choice, and at least it happened to work out perfectly with the end of a chapter: this is going to be the last page until at least the first week of 2021.\r\n\r\nWhen I started posting this eleven months ago, I had all four pages of the prologue done along with all of chapter one. When chapter one was done, I think I was just finishing up page thirteen or so of chapter two. And right now... I only have the background done and half the characters sketched out for the first page of chapter four.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason is, I hope you understand, a bit of a loss of enthusiasm. Not that I'm not committed to finishing this thing, but it's not all shiny and new anymore, it's down to the grind.\r\n\r\nMore than that, though, is just that things got more complex as the story went on, in terms of characters. If you look at chapter one, there's maybe a max of three or four characters per page. This page, alone, has fifteen characters. Which is just natural, given the story, and something I knew was coming, I just didn't completely foresee how it would affect my time to complete each page.\r\n\r\nWhat I need to do, I think, is work harder at my composition skills. Get more done with less characters, in other words. The first panel here is a good example of what I can do, and I've already started applying that to the page I'm working on now.\r\n\r\nIn any case, with a month break, plus the extra time I'll get from taking off work during the holidays, I can hopefully build up at least a five page lead, and then keep that buffer in place from then on. At the very least, I can keep it going through chapter four and take another small break before the next chapter, and just keep doing that.\r\n\r\nIn any case, loving all the enthusiasm I've been seeing for this, and I hope I can keep things up for you moving forward. In the meantime, enjoy the holidays, and I'll see you next year.\r\n",

We are facing off against Mexico, and this is a very important match for us. I don't care much about sports or soccer at all, but I've been feeling this patriotism and pride lately because we've been doing things right to be able to possibly get our spot in Brazil's world cup next year, and this could be our opportunity to be there.\r\nWe are #2 in our group, just because Mexico has been setting forward some matches and we are doing very good, we came from nothing to something, and this art is to show you that we may be a small country (only 3 million of people) but we are fierce! and united, we come stronger than ever, and we will win! (nothing against Mexicans though, but we must win, sorry)\r\n\r\nWhich pony could be perfect than our beloved party mosnter, Pinkie Pie rooting for Panama with her huge #1 gauntlet, this is my way to show my support to our team that has been working very hard to be were they're at.

      "description": "[bq]And now for a surprise feature on my MLP FiM Swimwear line-up, everyone's favorite bitchy yet probably complex bad girl griffon (and mine as well), Gilda!\r\n\r\nI especially love this character, and I mean literally love Gilda. <3 And I know all of you are gonna say something like “But she yelled at Fluuttershyyy!” Or something like that. But I have an excuse for that, she would be considered my most favorite villain on the show then (next to Tirek from G1). But I'm sure this kind of argument would be dated by now, right?\r\n\r\nWhat really drawn me into liking Gilda so much was the fanbase surrounding her. Half of every fanart that was Gilda-related had portrayed her to later seeking redemption for herself or just being faulty. And I think that's how I would consider her as, being just faulty with her character and struggling between showing some form of amity to anyone and her arrogance of pertaining her superior image. And since there are other griffons that reside in Equestrian society that are aren't all antagonizing, namely like Gustave le Grande, this almost clarifies that it isn't just Gilda being a griffon, but more of the equivalent of an archetypal tomboy bad girl that's misunderstood maybe. And it's also because of Gilda of that made me like griffons even more than usual. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nMLP FiM is owned by Hasbro and Lauren Faust\r\n\r\nPic done by Chad Coulter[/bq]\r\nPublished: Jun 15, 2012",

      "description": "Name: Hermetism Twily Skaza \r\nParents: Starlight Glimmer and Twinkleshine\r\nSibling: /\r\nRace: unicorn (Genes: 80% unicorn and 20% earth)\r\nHeight: 180 cm\r\nTalents: singing and dancing \r\nOccupation: singer\r\nCutie Mark: a note of yellow music with green and blue magic\r\nResidence: Canterlot\r\nFriends: Purple Screw and Flower Sleek\r\nEnemy: Jonagold \r\n\r\n+Personality/Bio:+\r\n\r\nThe birth of Hermetism has everything but the natural ! Starlight had forced birth with his magic, so that it would be born on the same day as Twilight’s daughter. His future was already decided by his mother, who would consider him the best pupil of Twilight for his powerful magic. After being forced to cheat to pass the entrance exam, Hermetism did indeed become Twilight’s studen, but not for his magic, for his protection. She had noticed the violent behaviour towards Hermetism and Twinkleshine, and wanted to avoid other problems, vis-à-vis her lack of magic. Twilight noticed very quickly that his talent was music and introduced him to Sweetie Belle, who took him as a pupil, and threw him into the small cabaret of his friend Tender Taps. He had his cutie mark on stage and his passion for music was so strong that he made wings appear during his songs.\r\n\r\nAround the age of sixteen, Starlight realized that his son would never be a great magician. But what made her explode with anger was when she learned that he loved another stallion, when she had already \"planned\" his marriage with Twilight’s daughter. She began to get angry, sending Twinkleshine ashore, with rare violence. Hermetism became angry, he was no longer afraid of her, and cast one of the protection spells that Twilight had taught him. Starlight stood up astonished and wanted to tie up, but Twilight stopped him and sent him to the hospital, in order to cure this anger and fascination with the alicorne. Hermetism had his mother relieved and after having raised, they moved near the small cabaret where Hermetism works and his popularity rose !\r\n\r\n+Relationships:+\r\n\r\nHis relationship with *Starlight* is very difficult! This one created him only to please Twilight and made him feel for many years. She terrified him during his childhood and was even more afraid, when he stood up to him ! For him, Starlight is not really his mother, she is just the other half of his creation.\r\n\r\nHe prefers his real mother, *Twinkleshine*, who has always loved him despite all his decisions. Their relationship is quite fused, having sustained during the Starlight period. Twinkleshine always believed in his voice and knew deep down that magic would never be his talent.\r\n\r\nHis best friend is *Purple Screw*, whom he will meet at art school. He was the singer of the end of year show and she took care of the sets. Purple Screw has always supported it and the duration to accept the offer of Tender Taps.\r\n\r\n*Tender Taps* is his mentor and allowed him to get on stage. They are working together on a new show. Hermetism appreciates all the knowledge and experience that the artist teaches it !\r\n\r\n*Sweetie Belle* is Hermetism’s singing teacher and helps her launch her singing career, outside of her friend’s cabaret. She loves her little prodigy and presents it to different personalities !\r\n\r\nThe most important stallion for him is *Flower Sleek*. He loves every moment he spends with him and develops sincere feelings towards him, which are reciprocal. At first very shy to show his relationship, Hermetism ended up accepting that critics can do nothing against love.\r\n",

      "description": "[bq]I vote for southest since we have no idea about whether or not darkness of the east path helps or hinders the shadows.[/bq]\r\n\r\nYou decide to travel across the plains to the southeast. As you begin to trot forward, you hear the hooves of the unicorns following close behind you, and the strong flapping of dragon wings further back.\r\n\r\nUnlike during the peaceful nights in Equestria, you find yourself on edge, surrounded by a darkness that feels almost unnatural. Your throat feels tight, your jaw is clenched, and you eyes dart around instinctively, as if looking for something lurking in the shadows that may or may not be there.\r\n\r\nAfter keeping a steady pace for several minutes, a small red light in the sky stops you in your tracks. You quickly duck behind the largest nearby stone, tailed by the rest of the group, and tentatively peek over the edge of your cover.\r\n\r\nYou have difficulty making out any clear shapes against the cloudy night sky, other than sort of large red glowing eye with black wings and a long tail. The way the creature phases around erratically reminds you of how the nightcrawler moved in your earlier encounter in the realm of Darkness.\r\n\r\nPurple unicorn: \"I think that's a nightcrawler. It looks like one of those monsters we saw in the generator room.\"\r\n\r\nSmoke: \"Heh. Good thing you brought me along to take care of it!\"\r\n\r\nAs Smoke spreads her wings and prepares to take off — no doubt eager to try out her new weapon —, you motion for her to wait. When she raises a brow, you remind her that if those monsters are linked to Empyrius somehow, then attacking one of them might alert him. She frowns at that.\r\n\r\nSmoke: \"Oh, come on. I've dealt with these guys before. Better I get rid of it now than risk all of us getting caught, right?\"\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, she makes a good point. If the nightcrawler is taken down by a lone mischievous dragon, then whoever is behind them might not suspect any ulterior motives. You nod, and ultimately agree to do it her way.\r\n\r\nSmoke: \"That's what I like to hear!\"\r\n\r\nWith a wide grin back on her snout, Smoke runs out into the field. Then, with a powerful flap of her wings, she shoots up into the air, the blade of her sword glowing hot as it cuts through the wind.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, the dragon takes the shadowy creature by surprise, hacking and slashing at it before it can so much as blink. The sheer force with which the nightcrawler is torn apart reminds you all too well of your friend's draconic nature. Next to you, the unicorns watch the display in awe.\r\n\r\nWithin seconds, a large quantity of red sparkles bursts forth from the slain creature, flying westward, and leaving no physical remains behind. Then, as swiftly as she left, Smoke returns to your side, and gracefully twirls the sword around before stowing it.\r\n\r\nSmoke: \"That felt good! You didn't tell me that this sword was magical. It's pretty awesome!\"\r\n\r\nYou admit that you've never had to draw your weapon, let alone swing it, though you are glad that she could put it to good use. She pats you on the head in response, looking almost sorry for your pacifist lifestyle.\r\n\r\nBrown unicorn: \"A magical weapon? Is magic also effective against these things? Huh, the more you know...\"\r\n\r\nFrom what you've heard, it seems somewhat odd that a common enchanted blade would be effective against nightcrawlers, but you are not knowledgeable enough about either of those things to question it further. For now, it is good enough to know that it worked.\r\n\r\nWith no more trouble in sight, you resume your mission, and continue heading southwest. By the end of the hour, the volcanic lands of Serpent's Bite finally come into view.\r\n\r\n• To the east, a dark cave lies at the foot of a mountain, offering shelter from the frigid wind. What lies within is a mystery, though the thick stone walls could well keep the sounds of digging a secret.\r\n\r\n• To the southeast, a valley weaves between ashen crags, with a steaming river running through. While streamside jagged stones offer a promising glimmer, the cliff walls threaten to form a massive echo chamber.\r\n\r\n•To the south, the distant light of an outpost oversees a stone quarry, more than likely the property of the Order of Dawn.\r\n",

We reformed him and he didn't stop causing trouble until very recently. How can we trust that you won't do the same?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well you can at least give me a chance like you did for Discord. What about the changelings, Stygian, Luna, Starlight! All of them had two chances to reform, and now they are all your friends, two of them are royalty for Celestia's sake!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well once again, Thorax was never bad to start, he never wanted any of it and his kingdom followed him, Stygian had good intentions and was cast out due to a misunderstanding, Luna was good at the start and got caught up in jealousy, and Starlight was hurt because she lost a friend. All of them started out good at least at filly age if not older.\"\r\n\r\n\"THAT'S WHAT YOU DON'T SEE IN ME!!!\" Cozy yelled, \"MY PARENTS ABANDONED ME! AND AS AN ORPHAN NOPONY WOULD EVEN GLANCE AT ME SO I HAD TO LEARN TO GET THEIR ATTENTION! I WASN'T BORN LIKE THIS!\" \r\n\r\nTwilight took a step back, \"Don't yell at me.\" she said, \"I was unaware of your situation, maybe we can talk about this\"\r\n\r\nCozy's eyes fired with anger, \"No! How dare you not consider me until you know what I've been through!? I thought the princess of friendship would be a lot kinder and more forgiving! You were willing to accept Starlight before you knew her story! What's so different about me!? Is it that I'm a filly!? If so you're a psychopath! What kind of Pony is willing to turn a filly to stone without a thought just because they made mistakes! If anypony should be turned to stone it should be you.\"\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nI hope you liked that little storyline!

      "description": "Oh Rarike! My favorite Rarity ship, and the one I will always eventually choose!\r\n\r\nRarity was always oblivious to Spike's feelings, or so she seemed, she actually knew very well that he had a crush on her, but that was it, she didn't know just how much his feelings stretched, Spike had always stuck to her like glue, but soon realized that wasn't getting him anywhere, so he backed off, but his love for his beautiful unicorn still burned in his heart.\r\n\r\nBut after awhile of seeing Rarity going on casual dates with stallion's and even gaining a boyfriend, a young stallion named Thunderlane, Spike couldn't take it, he was extremely hurt and Rarity noticed it immediately.\r\n\r\nShe loved Thunderlane, but now she was realizing the full weight of the situation. She started spending time with Spike to cheer him up, all well maintaining her relationship with Thunderlane. Spike appreciated her efforts, but he knew it was a lost cause of him ever being with her.\r\n\r\nOf course, after a few months of being with Thunderlane, they realized they both wanted different things, Thunderlane wanted to get married and start a family, while Rarity wanted to take their relationship slow while she worked on her fashion career.\r\n\r\nThunderlane couldn't understand so Rarity broke up with him, but first directed him over to his best friend Cloudchaser who she had noticed was always looking after Thunderlane longingly. So Rarity and Thunderlane parted ways on good terms.\r\n\r\nSpike was sorry for Rarity but also relieved, there might still be a chance. So, on the day of the Ponyville Carnival, he asked her out, to which Rarity was conflicted, she knew he liked her, but she had no idea if she liked him back, and he was way too young for her, so she carefully told him that it wasn't possible.\r\n\r\nSpike was heartbroken, and went home, Twilight comforted him as best she could but Spike eventually retreated to his room in defeat. Of course, Spike is smart, and as he was moping, an idea struck him. He came out and asked Twilight if she could turn him into a pony temporarily. It took some convincing, but Twilight eventually sighed in defeat and agreed.\r\n\r\nSpike had until midnight, and went again to ask Rarity again, Rarity was confused at first, but then after a few moments, realized what was going on, she agreed, deciding it wouldn't hurt one bit.\r\n\r\nThey had fun until midnight, when Rarity kissed him, right as the clock struck twelve. Spike was surprised when she announced she had known all along, but was happy she had a fun time. They headed home, and that's when Rarity felt the fluttering in her chest, the feelings for Spike that had been buried deep for so long.\r\n\r\nAfter that the two went on as normal, and the few times they got to see eachother, living in different towns, they were reminded of that date and gave eachother knowing looks.\r\n\r\nIt was a little while of this, until Spike came up with the idea of an age spell, he didn't need to wait to be with Rarity, they could be together now. Twilight realized this too, but knew that if he went through with it, he would miss many of his young, carefree years, but Spike didn't care, his love for Rarity was pure and true.\r\n\r\nTwilight still didn't agree, but went through with the spell anyways.\r\n\r\nIt was weird at first, suddenly being an adult, but it was worth it. Rarity was overjoyed, and seeing him as a adult dragon made her realize how much she really did love him, and how handsome he was now, but he still had that typical Spike look.\r\n\r\nIt was a few years of dating, but they soon finally got married and are now living together at Carasal Boutique, Spike is away in Canterlot a lot, but then again, Rarity was usually away checking in on her other Boutiques anyway, but they were usually back in Ponyville at the same time and they are content.\r\n\r\nHope you guys enjoy, and thanks for stopping by!",

Soon after Twilight Sparkle & her friends made peace with the hippogriffs did her small village finally get company from another species. Her grandmother owned a small brew shop that was handed down to her by her family. Kiwi Tang was taught the ways of making drinks and refreshments from the local fruit in her village. Earning her the cutie mark she now has. Princess Luna knew about Kiwi's village for centuries before the hippogriffs even thought about traveling there, because she placed the ponies there herself. Each and every bat pony. The village is completely run and cared for by the friendly bat ponies. Yet it's a slight hidden gem for the most part.\r\n\r\n𝘗𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘺: Kiwi Tang is a slightly sassy bat mare with a sharp tongue. She hates to be proven wrong and will do everything in her might to back track any fact you throw her way. She's quite stubborn and hard to budge. She didn't even want to leave her village, but she eventually did after being talked into it by her grandmother. Though it may not seem like it, she has a soft heart. She has an even softer spot for subs. She's compassionate about her hobbies, which include, volley ball and swimming. She's also very loyal yet when given the wrong information, she can betray you. But it's only if she get's confused.",
